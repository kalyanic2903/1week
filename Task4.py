# Expression: result = 25//4*3 + 18%7 - 5*2/2

#1: Integer Division (//)
25 // 4 = 6(because 25 // 4 is the integer division of 25 by 4).

#2: Multiplication (*)
6 * 3 = 18.

#3: Modulus (%)
18 % 7 = 4 (because 18 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 4).

#4: Multiplication and Division (* and /)
5 * 2 = 10.
10 / 2 = 5.0 (division results in a float).

#5: Putting it all together:
18 + 4 - 5.0 = 22 - 5.0 = 17.0

#Final result:
Result = 17.0.
